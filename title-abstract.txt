Title:
Capstonian: An HDSI Capstone Search Gallery

Abstract:
A monumental aspect of the UC San Diego Halıcıoğlu Data Science Institute (HDSI) program is the senior capstone. Fourth year DSC students collaborate with UCSD and industry mentors through a two quarter-long project that is later showcased at the end of the winter quarter. These projects are seen as a culmination of the knowledge that students obtain from the previous years. While the annual capstone showcase is a great way to celebrate the graduating class and their hard efforts, there is no easy or accessible way to display their work past the showcase. Previous capstone projects can only be seen by manually navigating through archived links. It is difficult for current third year DSC students to get a look at past projects as they navigate their capstone domain selections. Our project aims to remedy this issue by creating an efficient, user-friendly and publicly accessible search tool for all senior capstone projects. This solution will allow current students, faculty, and industry professionals to easily explore past projects. First, we scraped the public data from the currently available archives. Next, we extracted the relevant information from each project. We then employed Elasticsearch, which ingested all the data and efficiently and accurately returns relevant projects when queried, and tuned it using NDCG, an evaluation metric. To make our project publicly accessible, we use React in JavaScript to implement our frontend website, FastAPI to manage our API endpoints, and finally a virtual machine in Azure (cloud) to deploy our full stack website.
